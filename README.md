# Real-Time-Data-ingestion-and-Analysis-with-Azure

In this Project, I have implemented a comprehensive solution using Azure services, including Azure Event Hubs for real-time data ingestion, Azure Stream Analytics for data processing, Azure Blob Storage for data storage, and Azure Synapse Analytics for data analysis and visualization. By creating a data pipeline and scheduling ETL processes, we can efficiently manage the data and derive actionable insights


1. Azure Event Hubs:
   - Set up for real-time data ingestion.
   - Handle millions of events per second from diverse sources.

2. Azure Stream Analytics:
   - Process and analyze streaming data in real time.
   - Write SQL-like queries to filter, aggregate, and enrich data.
3. Azure Blob Storage:
   - Store processed data in various formats for accessibility.
   - Organize data efficiently for easy retrieval.

4. Azure Synapse Analytics:
   - Analyze stored data and create complex queries.

5. Data Pipelines and ETL Processes:
   - Create data pipelines to orchestrate data flow from Blob Storage to Synapse SQL database
   - Set up scheduled ETL processes for automated data extraction, transformation, and loading.
